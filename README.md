# echox

We're big fans of [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) here at Datum, and [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/labstack) the project where we're able. The main version of Echo is v4, but there's been [lengthy discussions](https://github.com/labstack/echo/discussions/2000) about a v5 which have not yet manifested. After thoroughly reviewing the [v5](https://github.com/labstack/echo/tree/v5_alpha) changes and comparing them to the v4 branch, it would be a very large undertaking to adopt in the future if we took the v4, so we've elected to create + manage an ongoing fork of the v5 branch and pull in bug fixes, features, etc., from the main codebase.
